/* Definition of an L-systems:
 * a. [Alphabet] An L-systemâ€™s alphabet is comprised of the valid characters that can be included.
 * b. [Axiom] The axiom is a sentence that describes the initial state of the system.
 * c. [Rules] The rules of an L-system are applied to the axiom and then applied recursively, 
 *            generating new sentences over and over again. An L-system rule includes two 
 *            sentences, a "predecessor" and a "successor".
 *
 * Let's rebuild the cantor set in an L-System:
 * Alphabet: A B
 * Axiom: A
 * Rules: (A -> ABA) (B -> BBB)
